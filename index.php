<br>
<left><p>The effect of the corruption is that the other people will suffer from the damges and the government will not do anything about it.
<br>
<p>It may lead into damges into street, buildings and etc
<br>
<p>Also this past few days we could use some of the money  that we pay to the government and the government will provide the protection againts the new covid19.</p>

Dove is a symbol of hope for us because in the bible,
<br> a dove released from Noah's ark returns with an olive branch to show the flood was over.
<br> It was a sign for them that there's still hope when the dove came back.
<br> We want the dove to give the people sign that there's still hope even if they thought there's already no chance for them.
<br>
<br>
<left><p>Message of hope:
To those people suffering from depression and anxiety because of this pandemic,
<br> I want you to think that someday everything will be back to normal.
<br> Someday, you can already talk to your friends and go outside without having a fear that you might be infected of the virus.
<br The fear that you feel is normal and if you want to talk to someone, don't feel shy about opening to your parents.
<br> Im really sorry because you would experience this but always remember that everything will be fine.</left>
